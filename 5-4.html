                <p class="lightGreyText">Nestled at the foot of Mount Snowdon, 
                    the highest mountain in Wales, this hostel has a rich history 
                    tied to mountaineering and the great outdoors. Originally built 
                    as a coach inn in the late 1800s, it served travelers journeying 
                    through the rugged terrain of Snowdonia.
                    What makes Pen-y-Pass special is its role in outdoor culture. 
                    Over the decades, it became a base for legendary climbers who 
                    tackled the Snowdon Horseshoe—a challenging circuit of ridges—and 
                    contributed to the development of modern mountaineering in the UK.

                <p class="parag">Located in a beautifully preserved 
                    Victorian mansion built in 1885, the HI Sacramento 
                    Hostel offers a glimpse into the grandeur of California's 
                    past. Originally the home of a wealthy gold prospector, 
                    the mansion later became a boarding house and eventually 
                    a hostel. Its elegant architecture, complete with stained 
                    glass windows, carved wooden staircases, and period furnishings, 
                    makes it a unique blend of history and hospitality.

                <p class="blueText">Once a courthouse in the heart of London, 
                    Clink78 Hostel is steeped in history. Built in the 19th 
                    century, the building was where Charles Dickens worked as 
                    a court reporter, inspiring elements of his famous novel 
                    Oliver Twist. In the 20th century, it served as a magistrates' 
                    court and famously hosted trials for punk bands like The Clash. 
                    Today, the hostel preserves its legal heritage—guests can stay 
                    in refurbished prison cells and relax in the courtroom-turned-lounge.
